</p>
<p>
The key is knowing how to work with the transits and cycles of Saturn because we do feel the the effects of it for a while since it is in a sign for about 2 1/2 years at a time.</p>
<p>

In general all Uranus ruled changes have several things in common: 
They strike like lightning. They tend to turn a person\'s world upside down. They are frequently beyond the control of the person involved.</p>
<p>
The changes are radical and cannot as a rule be reversed e.g. personal achievement, status in society -- public honour or notoriety; accidents; impersonal relationships.

<p><img src="images/neptune.gif" style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0" />This is the planet of transcendence. Illusion, delusion, image, spirituality, mysticism.

<p>
As the planet Neptune continually moves around the zodiac it passes over different areas in your personal birth chart. Since it is such a slow moving planet it will impact you for long periods of time.</p>
<p>
As an area is touched by Neptune it is best to know how that is affecting you. If it is a creative, inspirational impact then it is best to make use of it. On other hand it may point to times when you have to be more careful in your due diligence when it comes to both work and home life.
